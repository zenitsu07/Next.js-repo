This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


Here page.jsx is mostly rendered in required components
Layout => wrap all the pages
helps in wrapping all components with a default layout described here in RootLayout
Layout is used to have same layout for entire app while importiing children components too

In next js -> all compnents are rendfered on the server side thats why it takes too low loading up time and provides fast usage reliabilty 

Now In next.js callback functions and events can only be used in client side components
-> "use client"  -> this string can make a component act as client component to server 

-> we make a component to render as client side when we want to use callback fucntions or onclick action
OR Sign useState or useEffect
Recommended -> TO fetch data always use server side compoennts as its easier for SSR

In NEXT 12 TO fetch from API_KEy we need to use getstaticprops() not in Next13 => use fetch
